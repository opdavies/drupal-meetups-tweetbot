# Drupal Meetups Twitterbot

A CLI application designed to help promote Drupal meetups and provide a central repository of meetup related tweets.

The tweets are limited by both username and hashtag. If an approved user posts a tweet that contains an approved hashtag, then the app will automatically retweet it. To see what the current filters are, see [config.php](https://github.com/opdavies/drupal-meetups-twitterbot/blob/master/config.php).

To make any suggestions to either (e.g. to suggest a new meetup or hashtag) please open an issue and submit a pull request. Any approved users found to be using the hashtag for non-relevant content will be removed. 

The account that this app posts to is [@drupal_meetups](https://twitter.com/drupal_meetups).
